#subtitle: Paramilitary organizing in defense of the republic.

= Reichsbanner

The *Reichsbanner* <span style="color: #000000;"><b><i>Schwarz</i></b></span>-<span style="color: #DD0000;"><b><i>Rot</i></b></span>-<span style="color: #FFCC00;"><b><i>Gold</i></b></span> is a mass organization for the defense of the Republic against the extremists who threaten it. Some would call it a paramilitary, although currently it is hardly any sort of military. It is officially associated with the pro-democratic parties -the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?], and <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, but by far the largest component is with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

[? if workers_spd < 46 or workers_spd < workers_nsdap or workers_spd < workers_kpd : The Reichsbanner is having a more difficult time recruiting, as the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> is no longer the dominant party among the workers. Many of its members have left. ?]

Some in our party decry the increasing militarization of the Reichsbanner. They say it is emulating the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">right-wing nationalists</span> or the <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span>, and risks alienating our allies in the centrist parties. On the other hand, more left-leaning radicals are being lured to our organizations, away from the <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span>.

view-if: funded_reichsbanner >= 1
on-arrival: rb_militancy += 0.02; funded_reichsbanner -= 1

As we have already funded resources towards the Reichsbanner, we can invest in building up their militancy. 


@same

The Reichsbanner is already serving the purpose it needs to serve. There is no reason to change what already works.

- @return: Continue...

Cutting resources to the Reichsbanner causes a drop in the membership, and leads some would-be members to join the <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span> instead.

The suggestion to allow women into the Reichsbanner is ridiculed by most, except for Toni Sender. But this is an exceptional time, and we need anyone who is willing to join. Thus, we organize specialized units for women, [? if homosexual_rights > 0: and even some covert units for transsexuals and inverts?].

After allowing women to join, the number of comrades who leave is more than balanced out by the number of radicalized women and others who join. However, many of our departed members were veterans, and many of the new members have no experience with military-style training.
