= The <span style="color: #c00000;">**Iron**</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">**Front**</span>

The <span style="color: #c00000;">**Iron**</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">**Front**</span> is our new anti-<span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span> coordination front, consisting of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, the trade unions, and the Reichsbanner. How should we use the <span style="color: #c00000;">**Iron**</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">**Front**</span>?

[? if workers_sapt < 45 or workers_sapt < workers_nsdap or workers_sapt < workers_kpd : Unfortunately, the <span style="color: #c00000;">**Iron**</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">**Front**</span>'s effectiveness is dragged down by the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>'s unpopularity, as the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> is no longer the dominant party among the workers. Many Reichsbanner members have left, and many workers are not interested. ?]

- @defense: Rally for defense against the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span> with the Reichsbanner.
- @pacifism: Rally for pacifism, against nationalism and war.
- @republic: Rally to save the democratic republic against <span style="color: #7A3C00;">dictatorship</span>.
- @wtb: Rally for economic change and the WTB-Plan.

The <span style="color: #c00000;">**Iron**</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">**Front**</span> rallies for the militant defense of the republic against the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span> paramilitaries, strengthening the Reichsbanner.

unavailable-subtitle: [? if return_to_normalcy == 1: The economic crisis is largely over now, and the public is no longer interested in hearing about it. ?] [? if wtb_rally > wtb_implemented: Rhetoric alone has its limits; further implementation of the WTB plan is necessary to continue an effective campaign. ?]

The WTB-Plan is the rallying point for the entire <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> and its affiliated organizations, including the <span style="color: #c00000;">**Iron**</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">**Front**</span>. [? if not wtb_implemented: However, many still believe that the plan is merely an empty slogan and will remain skeptical until we actually implement it. ?]

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> and other <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> political movements are increasingly turning their hatred against the <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jewish</span> community of Germany. The <span style="color: #c00000;">**Iron**</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">**Front**</span> rallies in defense of individual <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jews</span> and the broader community against violence.
