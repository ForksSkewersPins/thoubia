= Relations with the Red General

While the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> remains steadfast in its commitment to a united front against the incumbent <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> government, the ADGB, our union, has shown some openness to an accommodation with General Kurt von Schleicher. He has also shown interest in winning over the union through his support for public works.

@schleicher_menu

- @spd_schleicher_adopted: Adopt a policy of cooperation with the Red General!
- @convince_spd_schleicher: Push the party toward a more cooperative line with von Schleicher.
- @united_front: Reiterate our opposition against the <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span>.

The ADGB leadership has now officially—although only in private—taken a stance in favor of cooperating with the "Red General." The union will attempt to leverage its influence over the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> to push our hesitant party leadership toward adopting the same position.

Gradually, a shift in opinion is becoming visible within the party. Otto Braun has now come out in support of making deals with the General.

Slowly but surely, the ADGB leadership is beginning to warm to the idea of constructive cooperation with the so-called "Red General." However, much work remains to be done—many within the union, and the overwhelming majority of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, remain firmly opposed to cooperating with the man [? if chancellor == "Papen": propping up the widely despised Papen cabinet?][? if chancellor == "Schleicher": who now heads a widely unpopular government?]. [? if wtb_adopted: Our adoption of the WTB Plan—and Schleicher’s public support for similar public works initiatives—has modestly increased the party’s willingness to consider cooperation. ?]

[? if otl_prussian_coup_seen: Furthermore, his role in the coup against our Prussian government has only deepened the animosity toward both him and the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>. ?] Rumors about our cooperation has damaged our standing among the working class.

We continue to argue for a united opposition of the democratic parties against the unpopular [+ chancellor +] government, and win support among the people for doing so.

on-arrival: schleicher_spd_r += 1; schleicher_spd_support += 1; schleicher_spd_influence += 1

Regular secret meetings between the ADGB, the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, and von Schleicher are being held. This will aid in reducing the mutual distrust between the party and the government.

@schleicher_distance

In recent months, Schleicher has gained significant sympathizers within the Reformist and Labor factions of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>. Sidelining them would provoke Schleicher’s distrust and stir dissent within their factions affected.

We may only demand one, as to not push our luck.

Despite rejecting Braun’s offer a few months ago, Schleicher has since reconsidered. With such a popular statesman on his side, his rule will gain legitimacy in the eyes of the <span style="color: #000000;">repu</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">bli</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">cans</span> and the public. Braun, in turn, will tirelessly advocate for a pro-Schleicher policy within the party.

Now, with control over the democratic bulwark once again, we can reassert democratic oversight over the bureaucracy and the Prussian police force, reversing the purges enacted under Papen and Schleicher.

The <span style="color: #c00000;">Social</span> General has lived up to his nickname: the means test for unemployment insurance has been abolished, and an eight-hour workday has been reinstated in select industries to "spread out" the work among more people. Funding for the Labor Ministry, gutted under Papen, has been restored, and welfare levels are climbing back from their absolute lows.

The downside is clear—Schleicher now holds significant leverage over the unions, and many workers are beginning to place their loyalty in the chancellor, rather than the party that fought to make this possible.

Although many <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> figures in the cabinet have already been replaced by <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> appointees, further reform is needed to nudge Schleicher’s government toward a more democratic appearance.

The Finance Ministry, previously held by Schwerin von Krosigk, is handed over to a more neutral, non-partisan banker. The Interior Ministry and the Minister without Portfolio post are assigned to the [? if dnvp_ideology == "Moderate": <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>?][? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span>?] moderate, Gottfried Treviranus. The Agricultural Ministry is granted to Hans Schlange-Schöningen, a [? if not kvp_formed and dnvp_ideology == "Radical": <span style="color: #7FCEB1;">**CNBLP**</span>?][? if kvp_formed: <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span>?][? if dnvp_ideology == "Moderate": <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>?] <span style="color: #385A38;">agrarian</span> in support of peasant homesteads.

Though these shifts may seem minor on the surface, the entry of more democratic-leaning ministers into the cabinet makes our continued support more palatable to both the party and our electorate—and subtly shifts the balance in key cabinet votes.
