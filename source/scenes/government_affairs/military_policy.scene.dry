#subtitle: Dealing with the Reichswehr.

= Military Policy

The Reichswehr is a deeply <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> institution that has been generally hostile to any notion of <span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span> or democracy. However, we now control the military as part of the government. What should we do to reform it?

- @increase_funding: Increase funding for the military to purchase its loyalty.
- @decrease_funding: Reduce funding for the military so we have more for social spending.
- @reform: Conduct a thorough reform of the ranks, reducing the influence of <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span> and making it more hospitable to us.
- @root: No change to military policy.

The military and the center-right parties are pleasantly surprised that we would increase military funding. Our membership tends to be anti-military, and is less enthused. Germany's neighbors are watching our military buildup with worry. [? if reparations >= 0 : This is not good for the reparations negotiations. ?]

The military has fewer guns and fewer soldiers. There is no hint of a coup yet, but we do not know where the line will be drawn. The center-right parties are committed to the military and deeply opposed to our budget cuts.

Many demobilized soldiers have joined the right-wing paramilitaries such as the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, and weapons are missing from our stockpiles.

on-arrival: coalition_dissent += 1 if (in_grand_coalition or (in_weimar_coalition and lvp_formed)); reichswehr_loyalty += 0.15; reichswehr_militancy -= 0.5 if reichswehr_loyalty < 0.5; budget -= 1; coup_progress += 1; dvp_relation -= 5; pacifism += 1; democratization += 1; dvp_right += 2; ddp_left += 1; lvp_right += 1; hindenburg_angry += 5;

Our efforts are at least somewhat successful; we have changed the recruiting and training patterns so that more soldiers from non-<span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> backgrounds can join, hopefully changing the culture of the forces. We have also removed some of the officers who supported the previous Kapp putsch.

The center-right parties are committed to the military and deeply suspicious of our efforts to reform it.
