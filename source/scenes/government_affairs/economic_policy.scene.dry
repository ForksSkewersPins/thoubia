We have already formulated an economic plan. Now we have to implement it. [? if budget < 0: If our budget falls too far into the red, a capital strike will almost certainly be triggered. ?]

@economic_plan_dilemma

The [+ public_works_name +] Plan was already implemented by the Brüning cabinet before us. Should we continue with the plan and potentially expand its scope, or should we pursue our own chosen economic strategy?

Our spending on public works has reduced the need for unemployment insurance and welfare, while also increasing tax receipts through the multiplier effect as the new money circulates in the economy, helping to recover some of our spending. We continue to reinvest most of this new revenue into the program.

The economy is finally showing signs of improvement. The bourgeois parties are pleased to see that we’re following through with their economic recovery plan and are offering their full support. The investor confidence generated by our successes has led to a small-scale revival of the private sector, along with capital inflows from foreign investors.

We have considerably expanded the public works program, and together with a campaign to raise wages, money is beginning to flow through the economy. The bourgeois parties express concerns about inflation and spending, preferring a more cautious approach. However, they accept our plan, reassured by the surplus we’ve built up.

Unfortunately, we do not have the budget to begin buying out industrial facilities.

The capitalists are, predictably, up in arms about our policy of nationalization without compensation. They call it illegal expropriation, and it is. Nevertheless, it is clear that they have failed by keeping their factories idle, and we must take radical action.

[? if nationalization_progress == 1 : We have begun acquiring idling enterprises from the capitalists[? if works_councils >= 1: , and running them in coordination with empowered works councils ?]. By keeping production going, we can stave off the rising unemployment. ?]

[? if nationalization_progress > 1 : We acquired additional underutilized enterprises and run them in a coordinated <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> fashion with the works councils, hiring formerly laid off workers. A significant portion of the economy is now under public control. ?]
