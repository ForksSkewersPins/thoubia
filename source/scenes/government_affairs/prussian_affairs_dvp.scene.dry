= Prussian Affairs

Prussia, by far the largest and most important state in Germany, is governed by our party, in a coalition with the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?], [? if ddp_name == "DDP": <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**Democratic**</span>?][? if ddp_name == "DStP": <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**State**</span>?] and <span style="color: #C0A054;">**People's**</span> parties. It is a stable and democratic state government in Germany, led by [? if prussia_leader == "Braun": the able Otto Braun?][? if prussia_leader == "Brüning": Heinrich Brüning?][? if prussia_leader == "Stegerwald": Adam Stegerwald?]. [? if prussia_leader != "Braun": Without Braun at the helm in Prussia, our pace of action has noticeably slowed. ?]

We can enact policies in Prussia. The inclusion of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> will mitigate our effect.

The police have historically been overrun with <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span>, and we are trying to change this, little by little. We have improved the training and recruitment process to select for a broader demographic than the traditional <span style="color: #3E88B3;">conservatives</span>, and to put a tighter leash on their political activity. In addition, we set up committees to investigate the ranks of the police and remove those with <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> sympathies. It is a slow and arduous work.

The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> is sabotaging against our efforts in favor for the right.

Current police loyalty: [+ prussian_police_loyalty : loyalty +].

@police_strength
on-arrival: prussian_police_strength += 15

We have increased the size of the Prussian police.

The bureaucracy is deeply <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span>, and many abuse their power to favor the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">political right</span>. By removing the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">pro-monarchy</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">pro-dictatorship</span> elements, we can democratize it. Some of our opponents claim that we are infringing on individual freedoms, but perhaps the security of the republic requires it.

The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> fills up the bureaucracy with their own monarchist and industrialist sympathizers.

As it turns out, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> has many allies in the police and bureaucracy, such as in the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>. Our relationship with the police weakens, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> can still organize illegally, right under the police's noses.

[? if coup_progress >= 6: There are reports of an imminent coup by the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>. We have disrupted some of these plans, but the threat is still present. ?]

While an outright ban on the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> may be out of reach, we can make life as difficult as possible for the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Storm Troopers</span>. The most reckless among them can be prosecuted on charges of murder and related crimes, and we can ensure legal public demonstrations and meetings are protected from their unlawful disruptions.

The ban is enthusiastically carried out by the police, perhaps too enthusiastically. The <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span> take this as one more reason why the <span style="color: #c00000;">Socialists</span> are traitors to the <span style="color: #9B0000;">left</span>. However, the <span style="color: #000000;">moderate</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">center-right</span> parties approve, as do the police.

We have signed a Concordat between the Free State of Prussia and the Roman Catholic Church, guaranteeing religious freedom for Catholics in Prussia. This sets the stage for the negotiation of a national Concordat covering all of Germany.
