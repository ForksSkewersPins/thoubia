= Dealing with Toleration

We are currently providing external support to the government of Chancellor [+ chancellor +], but our influence has been severely weakened due to the formation of the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span> by former <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> members. Furthermore, the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span> is actively trying to distance itself from our support. How should we use our position?

title: End the toleration agreement with a vote of no confidence!

Are we sure about this? A vote of no confidence would trigger new elections, and potentially an increased vote-share for the extremist parties.

- @vonc: Yes, end this arrangement!
- @stay_course: No, we should stay the course.

We have called for a vote of no confidence, and have brought down this government. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] currently rules as acting chancellor.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

New Prussian elections have been set for [+ next_election_month_prussia : month +] [+ next_election_year_prussia +].

A double dissolution has shaken the people's faith in democracy, with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> exploiting the instability to claim that democracy is unworkable, and that Germany needs a strong leader.

While this is a setback, it is not the worst possible outcome, as new elections could have led to significant gains for extremist parties.

Unfortunately, the historically strict party discipline of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> has carried over to its successor, which has successfully rallied the party against the bill. However, this is sure to spark discontent within the party, as it struggles to maintain its diverse coalition while also attempting to implement its fiscal reform policy.

The motion passes! Despite the historically strict party discipline within the former <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>, the diverse base of the party has weakened the leadership’s control over its parliamentary delegation. However, this has left the incumbent cabinet vulnerable to strong attacks from the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #003755;">right</span>, as it further cements their association with the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span> in the eyes of their industrial backers.

[? if bruning_austerity_limited == 1: We have successfully prevented Brüning from decreasing taxes on high earners, thus lessening the burden of compensatory tax increases on the lower strata. ?][? if bruning_austerity_limited == 2: We have successfully pressured Brüning into appeasing us by reinstating the 40-hour workweek, although wages remain suboptimal. ?][? if bruning_austerity_limited >= 3: We have successfully pressured Brüning into reversing some salary cuts for civil servants. ?]

However, the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalist</span> elements of the <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span> continue to obstruct our efforts to foster constructive cooperation with Brüning.

Our attempts to reach out to the center-right are met with disdain from the leftists within our party.

@stay_course

We will stay the course of toleration, for the sake of stability.
