= Prussian Affairs

Prussia, by far the largest and most important state in Germany, is governed by our party, in a coalition with the [? if in_popular_front_prussia: [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?], [? if ddp_in_popular_front_prussia and not lvp_formed: [? if ddp_name == "DDP": <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**Democratic**</span>?][? if ddp_name == "DStP": <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**State**</span>?]?] and <span style="color: #700000;">**Communist**</span> parties.?][? if in_left_front_prussia: <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>.?] It is the most left-wing state government in Germany, led by Kurt Rosenfeld.

We can enact policies in Prussia. [? if president == "Hindenburg": However, President Hindenburg and the political right are closely monitoring our every move and can invoke Reichsexekution at any time. Tread lightly. ?]

The police have historically been overrun with <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span>, and we are trying to change this, little by little. We have improved the training and recruitment process to select for a broader demographic than the traditional <span style="color: #3E88B3;">conservatives</span>, and to put a tighter leash on their political activity. In addition, we set up committees to investigate the ranks of the police and remove those with <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> sympathies. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> have also began to infiltrate some of their own into the police force...

Current police loyalty: [+ prussian_police_loyalty : loyalty +].

@police_strength
on-arrival: prussian_police_strength += 30; rfb_strength += 50

We have increased the size of the Prussian police.

@bureaucracy
on-arrival: prussian_police_loyalty += 0.08; nationalism -= 5; pacifism += 1; democratization += 2; pro_republic += 3*(1-dissent); new_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if democratization >= 3; new_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if democratization >= 4; coup_progress += 0.5; dvp_left += 2; ddp_left += 1; lvp_left += 1.5; reichsexekution += 1; bureaucracy_goal_prussia -= 1; new_middle_kpd += 2

The bureaucracy is deeply <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span>, and many abuse their power to favor the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">political right</span>. By removing the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">pro-monarchy</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">pro-dictatorship</span> elements, we can democratize it. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> have also began to infiltrate some of their own into the state bureaucracy...

As it turns out, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> has many allies in the police and bureaucracy. Our relationship with the police weakens, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> can still organize illegally, right under the police's noses. [? if sa_banned_pro : Nevertheless, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> is substantially weakened by our ban. ?] 

[? if coup_progress >= 6: There are reports of an imminent coup by the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>. We have disrupted some of these plans, but the threat is still present. ?]

The <span style="color: #700000;">Communist</span> <span style="color: #700000;">**RFB**</span> is no longer banned.

Restrictions are lifted and police are deployed to protect <span style="color: #700000;">Communist</span> demonstrations and organizations from the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>.
