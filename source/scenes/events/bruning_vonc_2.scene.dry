= Tax reform

Due to the crisis of the Great Depression, government budgets have fallen and welfare spending has risen substantially. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has proposed another reform of German finances featuring unpopular tax increases.

Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has used Article 48 of the constitution for the first time in order to pass the bill. In response, a motion has been put forward to rescind the government's emergency powers, and if it succeeds, [+ chancellor +] is prepared to dissolve the Reichstag and call for new elections.

We have voted against the [+ chancellor +] government in a vote of no confidence. The moderates within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> under Westarp have finally resigned from their party[? if kvp_formed:&nbsp;to join the <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span> and?] to vote against our motion, although it still isn't enough to block it. 

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

We have once again voted in favor of the [+ chancellor +] government in a vote of no confidence. However, our parliamentary delegation is in open revolt over this decision and has announced they will disobey our orders, ultimately bringing down the [+ chancellor +] government regardless.
