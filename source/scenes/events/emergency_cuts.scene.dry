= Emergency budget cuts

Due to the crisis of the Great Depression, government budgets have fallen and welfare spending has risen substantially. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has used Article 48 of the constitution in order to pass an emergency bill cutting welfare spending.

[? if sapt_toleration : If we reject this, it would mean the end of the toleration agreement, and [+ chancellor +] would likely dissolve the Reichstag and call new elections. Of course, the workers are opposed to this policy, although it might be necessary for economic and political stability. ?]

The emergency policy passes under emergency rules, as the Reichstag is currently dissolved. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> use this as a recruiting tool, and so do we.

We have broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, and have voted against them in a vote of no confidence. Welfare has been saved, but at what cost?

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

New Prussian elections have been set for [+ next_election_month_prussia : month +] [+ next_election_year_prussia +].

A double dissolution has shaken the people's faith in democracy, with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> exploiting the instability to claim that democracy is unworkable, and that Germany needs a strong leader.

We try to convince the workers that this policy is necessary in order to maintain a stable parliamentary government, and to deal with the fiscal consequences of the depression. Still, this policy provides excellent recruiting fodder for <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>.
