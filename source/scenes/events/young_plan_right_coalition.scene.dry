= The Young Plan and the fall of the coalition

The Foreign Ministry under Gustav Stresemann has agreed to the Young Plan, an agreement with the Western powers to reduce Germany's reparation payments and give us more fiscal autonomy. Simultaneously, <span style="color: #002654;">France</span> will agree to withdraw its military occupation from the Rhineland.

While this seems to be a positive development for the country, the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, despite their moderation, opposes the plan, claiming that any reparations are a form of national slavery. They have called for a vote of no confidence against the government, supported by the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, 
<span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span> and the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, and for a referendum on the Young Plan.

We can either vote to bring down the government and hold new elections, or "tolerate" a government led by the remaining bourgeois parties.

By supporting the government, we have essentially entered into a "toleration" arrangement with the [+ chancellor +] government. We do not have a voice in the government, but we are responsible for its continued stability. The left of our party opposes this plan, and would rather that we hold new elections.

The Prussian coalition isn't able to survive either, pressure from the national conservatives within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> forces them to exit from the <span style="color: #000000;">bourgeois</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> coalition there as well.
