= The WTB Plan

Following Woytinsky's announcement of intentions to draft a national action plan to stimulate the economy through extensive public works, he, Tarnow, and Baade have presented the WTB Plan, named after them, to the ADGB and <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> leadership. While the ADGB has shown enthusiasm and formally adopted the plan, the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>'s economic expert, Rudolf Hilferding, along with Rudolf Breitscheid and party leader Otto Wels, are much more resistant, showing significant skepticism.

The fear of inflation caused by funding the plan through public works, especially with hyperinflation still fresh in memory, and the unwillingness to "play doctor at the bedside of capitalism," are the main reasons for the Centrists' reluctance. Maybe they can be convinced?

- @center_plan: Woytinsky is promising the workers false hope, retain our current policy.
- @wtb_plan: Action is needed, and is needed now. We will attempt to convince the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> to formally adopt the plan.

Woytinsky has good intentions, but Hilferding knows best. Nothing can be done to alleviate the depression. However, we have been increasingly under fire from the ADGB for our opposition, as they formally adopted the plan themselves and consolidated their demands at their "Crisis Congress." The Centrists are slowly losing their grip on the party.

@wtb_plan

Alright, but what can we do? Hilferding is stubborn in his belief that nothing can be done and will try his best to rally the party against the WTB plan.

@wtb_support
title: Utilize the widespread support for the WTB Plan among the grassroots.
unavailable-subtitle: Many workers haven't even heard of the WTB Plan.

An internal vote within the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>'s leadership is called to finally settle the matter. After a contentious debate, the majority of the party is convinced by Woytinsky's reasonings, and outnumbered, the Centrists under Hilferding are defeated.

With our hard work, we have finally convinced the majority of the party to adopt the WTB plan! [? if sapt_in_government == 1 : We can begin implementing the plan as soon as possible, as long as we have the Economic and Finance ministries. ?][? if sapt_in_government = 0 : We should emphasize the plan in our electoral propaganda. ?]

The collapse in our electoral performance and loss of voters to the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> have opened the party's eyes, and they are now ready to support our plan as a means to present a solution for the workers.
