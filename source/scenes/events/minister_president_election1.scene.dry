After a long-anticipated month, the date of the elections for the office of Minister-President has finally come. On the right, the <span style="color: #a86b15;">**TNDP**</span> runs party bureaucrat Oliver Sloth, while the <span style="color: #4e9933;">**AVPT**</span> too attempts to play it inoffensive and cautious, running a longtime party official of the center - cooperative with the junta before the republic, but also the new republic. Even further, the anti-republican parties of the <span style="color: #a22561;">**NTAP**</span>, <span style="color: #2f387f;">**FK**</span> and <span style="color: #441796;">**NT**</span> seem to have coalesced around the candidacy of war hero and veteran Tron Dahlin of the <span style="color: #a08464;">**VP**</span>.

Over on our side of the aisle, things are more splintered. We have backed the candidacy of [+ sapt_candidate +]. [? if palmgren_campaign : Palmgren's candidacy has been met with disdain on our party's right-wing and trade unionist wings, as well as the <span style="color: #e49c21;">**LAPT**</span>. [? if kpt_votes < 20 : It has, however, been backed by the <span style="color: #990000;">communists</span>. ?] ?][? if posse_campaign : Posse's campaign has been backed somewhat reluctantly by the <span style="color: #e49c21;">**LAPT**</span>, as well as the whole of our party. ?][? if aspelund_campaign : Aspelund's campaign has been backed by the <span style="color: #e49c21;">**LAPT**</span>, naturally, as well as components of the <span style="color: #f5e324;">**RPT**</span>'s left dissatisfied by their choice of candidate. ?]

The <span style="color: #f5e324;">**RPT**</span> has endorsed Matteo Hellqvist, a businessman and media mogul who has been known to look strongly to Orthaland for inspiration. Though Gr√∂nblom was expected to run, it seems he has been forced to further concede to the industrialists.

[? if island_campaign : The <span style="color: #990000;">**KPT**</span>, finally, has also just barely qualified to run a candidate, and has such run their leader, Ernst Island, for the position. ?]
