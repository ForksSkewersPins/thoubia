= The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> Rejoins Government

The Young Plan has been ratified, and the controversy surrounding it has largely subsided, prompting the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> to rejoin the cabinet it had previously abandoned. Their primary motivation for reentering the government is their fear of <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> influence over Brüning's policies due to our toleration of Brüning’s administration. As a result, Brüning no longer depends on our votes.
