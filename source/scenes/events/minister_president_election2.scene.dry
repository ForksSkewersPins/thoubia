= First Round of Minister-Presidential Elections

After a long-anticipated month, the date of the elections for the office of Minister-President has finally come. On the right, the <span style="color: #a86b15;">**TNDP**</span> runs party bureaucrat Oliver Sloth, while the <span style="color: #4e9933;">**AVPT**</span> too attempts to play it inoffensive and cautious, running a longtime party official of the center Paul Haavik - cooperative with both the republic and the junta before it. Even further, the anti-republican parties of the <span style="color: #a22561;">**NTAP**</span>, <span style="color: #2f387f;">**FK**</span> and <span style="color: #441796;">**NT**</span> seem to have coalesced around the candidacy of war hero and veteran Tron Dahlin of the <span style="color: #a08464;">**VP**</span>.

Over on our side of the aisle, things are more splintered. We have backed the candidacy of [+ sapt_candidate +]. [? if palmgren_campaign : Palmgren's candidacy has been met with disdain on our party's right-wing and trade unionist wings, as well as the <span style="color: #e49c21;">**LAPT**</span>. [? if kpt_votes < 20 : It has, however, been backed by the <span style="color: #990000;">communists</span>. ?] ?][? if posse_campaign : Posse's campaign has been backed somewhat reluctantly by the <span style="color: #e49c21;">**LAPT**</span>, as well as the whole of our party. ?][? if aspelund_campaign : Aspelund's campaign has been backed by the <span style="color: #e49c21;">**LAPT**</span>, naturally, as well as components of the <span style="color: #f5e324;">**RPT**</span>'s left dissatisfied by their choice of candidate. ?]

The <span style="color: #f5e324;">**RPT**</span> has endorsed Matteo Hellqvist, a businessman and media mogul who has been known to look strongly to Orthaland for inspiration. Though Gr√∂nblom was expected to run, it seems he has been forced to further concede to the industrialists.

[? if island_campaign : The <span style="color: #990000;">**KPT**</span>, finally, has also just barely qualified to run a candidate, and has such run their leader, Ernst Island, for the position. ?]

In first place is Dahlin, with [+ dahlin_votes +] votes. Since he falls short of 176 - a majority - there will be a second round. There is no fundamental difference between the first and second rounds, except that for the second round, the first place candidate will win and become Minister-President, majority or not, and in the second round, 50 rather than 20 seats is required for a candidate to make it onto the ballot, including those already on the first ballot.

How the second round will unfold is heavily dependent on which candidates drop out, and who they back. The <span style="color: #4e9933;">**AVPT**</span> and <span style="color: #a86b15;">**TNDP**</span>, squashed in the center, will be forced to withdraw. Which way they will consolidate remains to be seen - some suspect they will back Dahlin and enter into a center-right government.

The <span style="color: #f5e324;">**RPT**</span> seems reluctant to withdraw Hellqvist, meanwhile. With their only options being to betray either their liberalism or their republicanism, they have chosen neither, even should it mean political isolation and the defeat of both. There is some talk that they will seek to have Hellqvist be the candidate of the center, backed by the <span style="color: #4e9933;">agrarians</span> and <span style="color: #a86b15;">national democrats</span>, though this seems unlikely due to the inevitable failure of such a coalition as well as the political disagreements between the blocs.

Somehow, we have managed to convince the <span style="color: #f5e324;">**RPT**</span> to back [+ sapt_candidate +] as the candidate of the <span style="color: #d4130c;">Social</span><span style="color: #e49c21;">-</span><span style="color: #f5e324;">Republican</span> front. Hellqvist is incensed by his own party's betrayal, however, and the <span style="color: #f5e324;">**RPT**</span> will likely in practice be quite split.

We have managed to convince the party to back Hellqvist, in spite of his laissez-faire beliefs, noting that the <span style="color: #d4130c;">Social</span><span style="color: #e49c21;">-</span><span style="color: #f5e324;">Republican</span> front must remain united even at the expense of our own goals if it is necessary to defend the republic. How much of our delegation will actually back him is questionable.

We have managed to convince the party to back Island, in spite of his Lenyoist alignments, noting that the unity of the working class will in the long run pay off handsomely.
