= <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> Party Vote

Following the disastrous Austrian customs union project, of which he was the architect, he has tendered his resignation from both the Foreign Ministry and the leadership of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>. This debacle has significantly discredited him and his allies on the party’s left wing, leading to a rightward shift within the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, particularly at the local level.

An internal election must now be held to determine Curtius’s successor. With the industrial wing largely weakened, none of the leading candidates have particularly strong ties to big business. Otto Thiel and Frank Glatzel, both members of the DHV - a conservative white-collar union - and leaders of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s Young Liberal wing, [? if not dvp_reform: are the leading voices pushing for a genuine People's Party?][? if dvp_reform: were instrumental in pushing the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> toward reform years ago?]. Meanwhile, Siegfried von Kardorff, a veteran parliamentarian despite his past affiliation with the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, has significantly moderated over the years and was a close follower of Stresemann, advocating for a Grand Coalition with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>. And, of course, Dingeldey is running again, undeterred by his previous defeat.

- @thiel: Otto Thiel is elected!
- @glatzel: Frank Glatzel is elected!
- @kardorff: Siegfried von Kardorff is elected!
- @dingeldey: Eduard Dingeldey is elected.

Surprisingly, Otto Thiel has been elected as the new leader of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>! Compared to his colleague Glatzel, Thiel leans further left within the party’s unionist faction. He has even voiced support for increased welfare spending, arguing that austerity measures would only deepen the hardships faced by the people. In his push for *Volksgemeinschaft*, he has begun introducing more labor-friendly policies into the party’s platform, backing collective bargaining rights and worker protections.

As expected, the remaining industrialists within the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> are outraged—even those with sympathies toward the late Stresemann. This has led to a dramatic shift in the party’s financial backing, as funding from big business dwindles and is replaced by donations and dues from the DHV and its affiliated members. [? if in_grand_coalition: We have noticed a significant decrease in coalition tensions. ?]

@glatzel
subtitle: Glatzel, being a former member of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> as well, has shown nationalist sympathies.

achievement: neuer_nationalismus

Frank Glatzel is elected to become the new leader of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, being more nationalist and right-wing than his colleague Thiel. He stands for a "New Nationalism," a solidarity among all classes, to defend the country's "<span class="tooltip-text" title="Lebensraum">living space</span>" and to create freedom for the people. In his push for *Volksgemeinschaft*, to reduce the conflict between the classes, he has begun including more nationalistic and corporatist elements into the party platform.

As expected, the remaining industrialists within the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> are worried, as the party begins to shift towards including the demands of the worker. This has led to a dramatic shift in the party’s financial backing, as funding from big business dwindles and is replaced by donations and dues from the DHV and its affiliated members. His <span class="tooltip-text" title="good mod">dynamic</span> leadership should be closely watched.

@kardorff
subtitle: Kardorff is able to secure the continuation of Curtius's leadership.
unavailable-subtitle: [? if dingeldey_unlock: His closeness to Curtius has undermined his position. ?][? if thiel_unlock or glatzel_unlock: The party prefers a new and dynamic leader, preferably not one with closeness to Curtius. ?]
choose-if: kardorff_unlock
on-arrival: dvp_leader = "Kardorff"; dvp_left += 3 if in_grand_coalition; liberal_cooperation += 3; bourgeois_cooperation += 3; dvp_relation += 5 if in_grand_coalition; new_middle_dvp += 4; catholics_dvp += 2; rural_dvp += 2; old_middle_dvp += 2; pro_republic += 3
face-image: img/portraits/kardorff.jpg

Kardorff is elected to succeed Curtius as the leader of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>. He is expected to be a continuation of Curtius's leadership, being another Stresemann follower and supporter of constructive cooperation with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>. [? if ui0_seen: He even rallied his parliamentary faction to save our Grand Coalition back in 1929.?]

[? if bruning_time: He is also one of the strongest supporters of the Brüning government, frequently coming into conflict with the right of the party over support for it. ?]

@dingeldey
subtitle: Dingeldey aims to revert all of Curtius's progress.
unavailable-subtitle: The right-industrial faction of <span style='color: #C0A054;'>DVP</span> lacks the required influence.

face-image: img/portraits/dingeldey.jpg

Eduard Dingeldey has unexpectedly won the vote to replace [+ old_dvp_leader +] as chairman of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>. Backed by broad and unified support from the party’s right wing, and endorsed by Ernst Scholz, he has narrowly clinched victory against Kardorff.

Dingeldey's election represents a significant and irreversible shift to the right,[? if dvp_reform:&nbsp;with him even repealing Stresemann's reform of the internal party structure,?] granting the industrialists back their lost influence on the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s decision making. [? if chancellor == "Brüning" and not sapt_in_government: Dingeldey doesn't even feel great loyalty toward the Brüning government and believes that the party could only fulfill its mission towards bourgeois concentration after it is freed from the burden of governmental responsibility.?] 

Furthermore, Dingeldey is not particularly interested in a closer relationship with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> and definitely not with us, but rather with parties to the right, such as the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> and even the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, to transform them into a 'constructive component of the state.' This does not bode well for the future of <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> democracy.
