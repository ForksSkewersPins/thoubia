= <span style="color: #b8110b;">**SAP(O)**</span> Defects

The <span style="color: #990000;">**KPT**</span> has absorbed the <span style="color: #b8110b;">**SAP(O)**</span>, which has finally gone from a party within our party to splitting irreconcilably and crossing the floor. The <span style="color: #990000;">**KPT**</span> has benefitted greatly from this merger, with morale reinvigorated.
