= Hugenberg's exit from the coalition

One of Hugenberg's first acts as leader of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> is to terminate the coalition with the bourgeois parties as expected. There is no other possible paths to a majority that excludes us, leaving us to determine whether Brüning continues governing or not.

We can either vote to bring down the government and hold new elections, or "tolerate" a government led by the remaining bourgeois parties. Alternatively, we could enter a reorganized Brüning cabinet.

Heinrich Brüning welcomes us into his new cabinet. Now, we have our pick of ministries.

By supporting the government, we have essentially entered into a "toleration" arrangement with the [+ chancellor +] government. We do not have a voice in the government, but we are responsible for its continued stability. The left of our party opposes this plan, and would rather that we hold new elections.
