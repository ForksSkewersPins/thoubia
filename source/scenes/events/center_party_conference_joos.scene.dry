= <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> Conference

[? if spd_break_toleration: Due to the breaking of our toleration agreement toward the [+ chancellor +] government, the right wing of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> finally has enough strength and anger toward the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> to oust the friendly Joos as leader. ?]

[? if z_relation < 40 and not spd_break_toleration: Due to the worsening of our relationship, even with Joos at the helm, the right wing of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> finally has enough power to oust the friendly Joos as leader. ?]

[? if concordat_explode and not spd_break_toleration and z_relation >= 40: Due to our lack of progress toward an agreement with the Vatican, the clerical wing of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> has forced Joos's resignation for his unwillingness to force the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> to take action. ?]

[? if secularized_a or abortion_rights or homosexual_rights and not concordat_explode and not spd_break_toleration and z_relation >= 40: Due to our progress on rights for women and <span style="color: red;">Ho</span><span style="color: orange;">m</span><span style="color: yellow;">ox</span><span style="color: green;">se</span><span style="color: blue;">ua</span><span style="color: purple;">ls</span>, the clerical wing of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> has forced Joos from the chairmanship, citing his unwillingness to obstruct these changes. ?]

Ludwig Kaas, a devoted Catholic priest is expected to succeed him, but Adam Stegerwald is once again running for the party's leadership. 

- @kaas: The [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] elects Ludwig Kaas as the party chair.

Ludwig Kaas has been selected as the chairman of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]. He represents a rightward turn from Joos, and will preside over a [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] less inclined to compromise with the left. 

Despite this, Kaas is committed to the current constitutional order and the republic. He maintains a close friendship with Eugenio Pacelli, the Papal Nuncio to Germany, which may prove useful during concordat negotiations.

Adam Stegerwald has been elected as the chairman of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]. He seems to represent a rightward turn from Marx, despite his trade union background, and will preside over a [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] less inclined to compromise with the left.

The [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]'s middle class wing are in uproar over the vote, despite Stegerwald conceding his leadership of the Reichstag delegation and the Minister-Presidency to his protege Heinrich Brüning. [? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": His election also attracts some Protestant <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> dissidents and industrialists, who may result in a shift of the party towards the right. ?]
