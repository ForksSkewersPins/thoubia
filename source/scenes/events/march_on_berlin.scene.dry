= March on Berlin

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> is mobilizing. Paramilitary forces of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, organized under the Harzburg Front, have marched on Berlin, threatening to violently overthrow the government.

They demand either immediate elections under the "supervision" of the nationalist paramilitaries, or else the immediate resignation of the government and the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor[? if hitler_deported : , and the revocation of his deportation ?]. It is obvious that they are threatening a civil war if their demands are not met.

@non_govt_menu

It appears that President [+ president +] is looking favorably upon the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascist</span> proposals. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has announced plans to resign.

Despite President [+ president +] standing with us against the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> marchers, he remains under pressure from the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span> in the streets and prioritizes a peaceful resolution above all else.

Still, [+ president +] refuses to accept any new election that is not truly free and fair.
