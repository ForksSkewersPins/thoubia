= The Second Brüning cabinet

The constant pressure from the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span>, along with the scheming of Hindenburg and his inner circle, has finally forced Brüning to reorganize his cabinet to the right. However, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span> remains excluded, as they remain uncompromising in their opposition to Brüning.

This move may temporarily soothe Hindenburg’s displeasure, but it leaves Brüning’s position substantially weakened and increasingly dependent on the whims of the presidential palace.

We must now decide whether to continue tolerating this more right-leaning Brüning government—now absent of leftist figures such as the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]’s Joseph Wirth—or to finally use this as a pretext to break away from it, as Brüning has introduced his third emergency decree, which further reduces salaries, and cuts pensions and welfare benefits to address the deficit caused by the banking crisis.

We have officially broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, voting against them in a vote of no confidence. Continuing to support such a government would go against all our values. The bourgeois parties have also joined in, choosing to cut their losses rather than engage in a futile attempt to save Brüning’s government.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

We are compelled once again to vote in favor of the [+ chancellor +] government to prevent the extremist parties on the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">left</span> from translating their growing popular support into parliamentary gains.

Despite the new right-wing cabinet, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span> is still refusing to support Brüning, as they want all the power to themselves.
