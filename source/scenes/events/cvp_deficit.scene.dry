= Deficit Spending

During the coalition formation process, we've promised the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span> to maintain a budgetary surplus at all times. We've failed.

[? if coalition_dissent < 3: The <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span> have given us more time, as they still believe that we'll follow through on our promises. ?][? if coalition_dissent >= 3: The <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span> have called a vote of no confidence against us. ?]
