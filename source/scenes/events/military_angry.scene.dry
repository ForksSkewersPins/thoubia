= Discontent in the Reichswehr

The Reichswehr, despite its evident bias toward right-wing <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> politics, has long portrayed itself as a non-partisan, neutral force in German affairs. Throughout most of the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Republic’s history, it has largely refrained from overt political interference. However, Defense Minister Groener—alongside his longtime ally Kurt von Schleicher and Chief of the Army Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord—has now made public the military’s growing disagreements and concerns with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

The Reichswehr remains widely respected across the political spectrum—except among the left-wing parties. Schleicher, long known as a political schemer, may attempt to exploit this to undermine our standing among our allies. We can either offer concessions to placate the military, or hold firm and do nothing at all.

We have accepted Schleicher’s demands for increased funding toward the army’s modernization program, securing the purchase of new equipment for the small force. This decision has drawn intense criticism from the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> and many within our own party, who condemn the diversion of funds into the black hole of the defense budget instead of toward welfare for women and children.

Our request to dismiss Wilhelm Groener has been approved by our coalition partners. He is replaced by Hans Oster, a relatively minor officer in the German Army. While Oster shares the nationalist leanings common within the military and is conservative enough to be accepted as Groener’s successor, our lack of control over the Reichswehr Ministry limits us—we can only remove a handful of officials involved in political interference.

Schleicher has been dismissed from the Office for Ministerial Affairs, and von Hammerstein, for now, has remained notably quiet.

The Reichswehr won’t go so far as to overthrow us, but Schleicher’s decade-long web of connections is proving effective. We are also the victim of a renewed propaganda campaign by the nationalist parties[? if pacifism >= 5:, which has fortunately failed to gain traction?]. [? if president == "Hindenburg": As a key figure in President Hindenburg’s camarilla, he has played a major role in stoking the old man’s growing hostility toward us. ?]
