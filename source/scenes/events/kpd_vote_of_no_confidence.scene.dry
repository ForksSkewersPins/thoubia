= Vote of No Confidence

The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> has called a vote of no confidence against us, due to our various policies and disagreements. If this succeeds, there will be an election in a few months.

How do we assuage the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>?

- @resources: Use our resources to reduce dissent within the coalition.
- @thalmann: Appoint Thälmann as chancellor instead of [+ chancellor +].

on-arrival: chancellor = "Thälmann"; chancellor_party = "KPD"

With great reluctance, President [+ president +] appoints [+ chancellor +] as chancellor.

Immediately, [+ chancellor +] goes to work building a "<span style="color: #750e0e;">Soviet Germany</span>": consolidating as much power as possible in the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, purging state institutions of anti-<span style="color: #700000;">communists</span>, and sending street fighters against the "enemies of the people".

In response to [+ chancellor +] being appointed Chancellor, the right-wing forces launches almost immediately launch an attempted coup. Troops of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> enter Berlin and immediately begin clashing with our supporters! <span style="color: #808080;">Reactionary</span> officers within the Reichswehr have taken their troops out of the barracks and joined them with the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> to stop the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> from taking power. We are forced to be on the same side as the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, whether we want to or not.

By transferring resources to our coalition partners, we can reduce their dissent against our policies. This is a crude, but effective solution.

We could try to boot the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> from our governing coalition, and form a new government with the bourgeois parties.
