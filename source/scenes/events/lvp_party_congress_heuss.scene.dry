= <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> Party Vote

Heuss's tenure as leader of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> has been marked by a decline in the party’s vote share and organizational membership. His relatively left-wing positions and affiliation with the Social Republican Wing have made him a divisive figure, with many blaming the party’s leftist and strong pro-<span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> stance for its dwindling appeal, as many middle class voters haven't reconciled themselves to the idea of the republic quite yet.

The industrial-right faction, along with the more local party organizations, are the main factions arguing for his removal, and submitted a vote of no confidence against him. Heuss does have a chance of winning, through the support of Stresemannite and ardent <span style="color: #000000;">repu</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">bli</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">cans</span> within the party.

Fortunately, Heuss has survived the vote of no confidence and will remain the leader of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>, securing support from Curtius and many Stresemannites. This victory will temporarily silence dissent from the right-industrial faction and strengthen our ties with the party.

Unfortunately, Heuss has lost the vote of no confidence and must step down as leader, paving the way for a right-wing successor. With strong backing from the industrial-right faction of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>, Dingeldey is now the frontrunner in the upcoming leadership election.

Eduard Dingeldey, previously part of the movement for bourgeois unity, has now been elected chairman of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>. Dingeldey is backed by the industrial forces on the right of the party, alongside former <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> members. He appears to be focused on fostering closer cooperation with the array of parties between the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>.

However, Dingeldey has thus far proven to be an ineffectual leader, often capitulating to the right wing of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>. Recently, we’ve observed a deterioration in relations with his party, alongside a noticeable rightward shift in the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>'s internal politics.

Despite this, Dietrich is a huge step up from Dingeldey's leadership, and is open to cooperation. However, his leadership has been quite uninspiring, to say the least. [? if agriculture_minister_party == "LVP" or economic_minister_party == "LVP": The responsibilities of his ministry prevent him from being involved in the day-to-day running of his party, which is now delegated to a group of his associates in the business wing. ?]

Julius Curtius, Stresemann's successor in foreign affairs and a former member of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, has won the vote to succeed Luther for the chairmanship. Curtius is supported by the 'Pragmatic Center', and was put forth as a compromise candidate. 

As a former member of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s left wing, he is in favor of closer cooperation with us. However, his leadership has been quite uninspiring, to say the least.
