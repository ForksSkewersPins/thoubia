= Young Plan Referendum

While the Young Plan seems to be a positive development for the country, the Right are gathering signatures to initiate a referendum this December. While the referendum itself is likely to fail, their propaganda is striking a chord with many, especially amid the ongoing depression. 

It comes down to us to campaign against the rhetoric of those that seek to destroy our republic. [? if sapt_in_government: We are able to use government resources for this campaign, lowering the cost for our party. ?]

- @pro_plan: Campaign in favor of the Young Plan and against the referendum.
- @no_plan: Do not campaign on the Young Plan, one way or another.

How should we campaign in favor of the Plan?

- @internationalism: As part of a broader campaign in favor of internationalism and pacifism.
- @rational: The Young Plan is simply the most rational choice for Germany.

We rail hard against nationalism and in favor of pacifism and belonging to the international community of nations. [? if radio >= 2: Our radio network has helped us spread our message.&nbsp;?][? if pacifism >= 3 and nationalism <= 50 : We have rallied the workers to the cause of internationalism. ?]Although the bourgeois are not too pleased for us having monopolized the campaign for the Young Plan.

We argue that the Young Plan is simply the most rational choice for Germany. Although it doesn't advance any broader political objectives, most people can get behind economic stability and recovery. [? if (z_relation >= 50 and (dvp_relation >= 40 and ddp_relation >= 40 and dvp_ideology != "Right" and not lvp_formed) or (lvp_relation >= 40 and lvp_ideology != "Right" and lvp_formed)): The bourgeois parties have rallied with us to campaign against the referendum and for the Young Plan.&nbsp;?][? if radio >= 2: Our radio network has helped us spread our message.&nbsp;?]

The referendum is easily going to fail with or without our presence in the campaign. However, nationalist sentiment is inflamed, and the right-wing parties are using our silence around the Plan as a tacit admission of its faults. Our silence has only emboldened the Right, especially the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>.
