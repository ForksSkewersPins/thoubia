= Vote of no confidence

Following the collapse of our coalition, President Hindenburg has appointed Heinrich Br端ning from the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] Party to head a government supported by bourgeois forces. [? if center_right_coalition < 50: However, despite the size of his coalition, the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span> lacks a majority, even with their preferred partner, the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberals</span>. ?][? if center_right_coalition >= 50: A majority is able to be found with the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span> forming a coalition with their preferred partner, the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberals</span>. ?]

Br端ning has reorganized his cabinet to include the smaller parties to the right of us, such as the <span style="color: #b8996f;">**WP**</span> and various smaller bourgeois parties. [? if center_right_coalition < 50: We are now faced with the choice to either "tolerate" the government to prevent the gains of extremists in the Reichstag or vote to oust Br端ning and push for new elections. ?]

We have broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, and have voted against them in a vote of no confidence. We also repealed their emergency powers.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

We try to convince the workers that this policy is necessary in order to maintain a stable parliamentary government, and to deal with the fiscal consequences of the depression. Still, this policy provides excellent recruiting fodder for <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>.

The bourgeois has survived without our toleration, leaving us as an opposition party.
